DCTreeMap is a project to combine and measure the benefits of DC's tree data, drawing from [Washington DC's District Department of Transportation (DDOT) Urban Forestry Adminstration (UFA)](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/d6364e8d068e4e558c82040569f5d33a_23); data from local non-profit [Casey Trees](http://caseytrees.org); and, over time, contributions from volunteers, using [Azavea's](http://www.azavea.com/) [OpenTreeMap](http://opentreemap.org) (OTM) platform. OTM brings a lot of value to this data in [analyzing the energy and resource savings of DC's urban canopy](https://www.opentreemap.org/analyze/) and [offering new opportunities for local individuals to engage with their city and their neighborhoods](https://www.opentreemap.org/engage/).

### About this repo

The following repository is for some of the key data, resources, scripts, and issue tracking for DCTreeMap. It is also used to make DCTreeMap a project of record under [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/projects/). The OTM platform code is not under this repository. Azavea [does offer this platform as FOSS](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/OTM2), including (and recommended) [a Vagrant version for easy local installation](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap/otm2-vagrant).
